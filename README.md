# Finding Lane Lines on the Road

## Overview

This is my first project of Udacity SDCND Term1.

The task of this project is to detect lane lines in the image and video using Python and OpenCV.

To complete the project, Canny, ROI, Hough Transform, Ployfit are deployed to detect the lane lines.

This repository is created for homework submission. 

I know the pipeline designed here has still a long way to go. Anyway, it is a good starting for me.

## Description of Files

The rubic of the project declaims the following three files.

1. A [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/P1.ipynb) file implementing the pipeline.

2. The test output of the pipeline, including the [test images output](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/test_images_output) and 
[test videos output](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/test_videos_output).
Also the [test images](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/test_images) and [test videos](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/test_videos) are provided for future improvement.

3. [Writeup](https://github.com/ChristianHe/SDCND_Term1_Project1/blob/master/writeup.md) of the pipeline.
